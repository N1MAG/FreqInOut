"""Receiver-safe software launch selections.

Observer / SDR profiles use the regular per-radio launch bundle, but their
launch entries are deliberately capability-scoped.  This module is Qt-free so
the guided setup, Settings, and launch planner all apply the same contract.

It does not attempt to configure an SDR driver or grant transmit authority to
an application. SDR++ supplies the receiver endpoint; an isolated JS8Call
instance may additionally be launched for receive-only ingest.
