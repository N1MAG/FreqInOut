"""Bounded, Qt-free receiver probe and reversible tune qualification.

This module coordinates an already-constructed receive-only application
adapter.  It does not discover devices, open vendor drivers, create workers,
persist configuration, or touch Qt.  Callers must execute it in the selected
endpoint lane (or another bounded worker) and provide one absolute monotonic
deadline plus cooperative cancellation callback.
